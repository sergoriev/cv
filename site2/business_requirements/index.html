<p>FSUE Russian Post – Russian state post operator with the largest subsidiary network (41 901 post offices) and 351 753 employees.In 2015, Russian Post entered the list of strategic enterprises of Russia. Unfortunately CSI as well as the company's image constantly declines. Also, clients believe that processes on post offices are outdated, and there is a need for some changes.</p>
<p>The main goal of this project is to increase the company reputation by implementing the following:
- Use high-tech devices to reduce the burden on employees;
- Reduce queues in post offices;
- Make visiting post offices a matter of not more than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>It will be possible with various CAO, such as:
1. E-queue with an (paid) opportunity to book certain time slots for getting/sending parcels.
2. Parcel delivery with <strong>QR</strong>-codes, pre-generated in PR application, through special vending machines.
3. Use notifications via SMS, different messengers (<em>Viber</em>, <em>Telegram</em>, etc.) instead of paper-notifications.
4. Live-stream of queue load in certain post offices.
5. Install feedback terminals.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-a-as-is-to-be-diagrams">Appendix A - "As Is" - "To Be" Diagrams</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="/img/as_is.png" />
<em>"As is" state</em></p>
<p>"As is" description:
1. Client receives post notification.
2. As usual, client takes queue ticket in post office via queue terminal (still not in every office).
3. Operator looks for parcel in database.
4. Operator searches for the parcel in post office. 
4.1 Client checks parcel content (optional).
5. Client signs post notification.
6. Operator gives parcel to client.</p>
<p>Current state of issues:
- It is not very practical to use paper notification - they could be lost, damaged. This procces also includes the fact that postmen need to bring this notification to a client, and human factor issues;
- If post notification isn't acquired, parcel can stay in office for a long period of time (relevant for goods from internet shops);
- Uneven workload of the department during the month, which complicates the assessment of the time that can be spent in the queue at the office;
- As usual client don't have opportunity to leave any feedback fast and easy, if they were dissatisfied with operator's service.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/img/tobe2.png" />
<em>"To be" state</em></p>
<p>"To be" state description:
1. Client receives post notification via SMS or a messenger.
2. Client authorizes in RP's app.
3. Client chooses payment method and pays to take parcel in needed time.
    3.1 If parcel less than X,Y (X - size of parcel, Y - value in money amount), operator sends parcel in vending machine .
    3.2 If parcel more than X,Y operator takes it to checkout window.
    3.3 RP's system generates special QR code linked to client's parcel.
4. Client receives this special QR code.
5. In post office client scanning QR code:
    5.1 At checkout window, if parcel more than X,Y, and takes it.
    5.2 In a vending machine, if parcel less than X,Y and takes it.
6. (optional) Client leaves feedback via feedback terminal.</p>
<p>"To be" state pros:
- Client receives notification just in time when parcel came to post office.
- Client still has an option to take his parcel in old way (wait in a queue), but new option can generate extra revenue.
- So, there is no need to wait in a queue anymore, if client wants to take his parcel at a certain time.
- Client can also leave feedback via feedback terminal, which gives Post offices managers extra information of employees work.</p>
