RP\u2019s reputation on the market is far from best. CSI as well as company's image constantly declines. Problem Statement According to the survey conducted among RP\u2019s clients, CSI noticeably decreased during the past 2-3 years. Operation processing time increased impacting the services quality. The company need to decrease operation processing time of typical services (parcels sending/delivery, payments, etc.) to improve their image. Analysis After the analysis of in-office daily tasks and typical operations we came to a conclusion that most clients (approximately 90%) are individuals (or companies\u2019 agents), who want to get or send parcel(-s). Other clients come to make other operations: various sorts of payments (utility bills, mobile fees, other services), stationery purchases, etc. So, here are the main ranked points: Clients need to get/send parcels fast (mostly relevant with business parcels), but the queue is very long and moves very slow. Sometimes the queue can consist only from pensioners or people wanting to make some sort of a service payment. Due to various circumstances the client can only get/send parcel at a certain time slot (lunch time, break, etc.) but it\u2019s unclear how long this operation may take. Insecurity and inconsistency of paper notifications which clients get in their mailboxes. These papers may be lost, forgotten or damaged. However, currently these notifications are just a formality. Paper notifications allow operators to quickly find parcel in the database, instead of using passport IDs. Solution Options Modification of the existing getting/sending parcel processes includes the following CAO: E-queue with a (paid) opportunity to book certain time slots for getting/sending parcels. Delivering parcel with QR -codes, pre-generated in PR application, through special vending machines. Use notifications via SMS, different messengers ( Viber , Telegram , etc.) instead of paper-notifications. Live-streaming of queue load in certain post offices. Install feedback terminals. Recommendations and Expectations After a thorough study of available solutions for the current issues, we came to a conclusion that all available options should be implemented during in the first iteration: Implementation speed. RP have all the necessary data (addresses, contacts, phones, and emails) about their clients for rapid and painless renouncement of paper notifications. Expanding the existing software. RP have their own web services and mobile app with client authorization. So the time slot booking feature for getting/sending parcels and QR assignment to parcels won\u2019t take too much time and budget. Making this feature paid can also generate additional revenue. CSI increase as soon as possible. By giving the customers an opportunity to instantly perform operations that previously took 10-20 minutes, Russian Post will significantly increase their CSI and optimize the operating time.","title":"Business case"},{"location":"business_case/#russian-post-service-modification","text":"","title":"Russian Post Service Modification"},{"location":"business_case/#definitions","text":"Post (Russian Post, RP) \u2013 Client company CAO \u2013 Complex Action for Optimization (automation) Client \u2013 client(-s), who use RP services CSI \u2013 Customer Satisfaction Index","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"business_case/#executive-summary","text":"FSUE Russian Post \u2013 Russian state post operator with the largest subsidiary network (41 901 post offices) and 351 753 employees.

Unfortunately CSI as well as the company's image constantly declines. Also, clients believe that processes on post offices are outdated, and there is a need for some changes.

It will be possible with various CAO, such as: E-queue with an (paid) opportunity to book certain time slots for getting/sending parcels.

The project will not be possible without this requirement. 2 High This requirement is high priority, but the project can be implemented at a bare minimum without this requirement. 3 Medium This requirement is somewhat important, as it provides some value but the project can proceed without it. 4 Low This is a low priority requirement, or a \u201cnice to have\u201d feature, if time and cost allow it. 5 Future This requirement is out of scope for this project, and has been included here for a possible future release. General/Base REQ# Priority Description Rationale Use case # BReq1 2 Only stuff with admin access level can apply changes in client's requests. - UC-011, UC-012 BReq2 3 Client should have an opportunity to look though all his confirmed and finished requests for all time. - - Security REQ# Priority Description Rationale Use case # SReq1 1 After QR code has been scaned, it should be removed from database. - - SReq2 3 Employees passwords should change at least 1 time in a month. - - SReq3 2 After operator received vending machine load request, he need to confirm this in a system. - - Usability REQ# Priority Description Rationale Use case # UReq1 2 4 of 5 novice user should perform \"Get parcel\" feature less than 4 minutes. - UC-011,UC-012 UReq2 4 Client need to have convinient access to \"Live translation of neccessary post office\" feature from any device. - - Appendixes Appendix A - \"As Is\" - \"To Be\" Diagrams \"As is\" state \"As is\" description: Client receives post notification. As usual, client takes queue ticket in post office via queue terminal (still not in every office). Operator looks for parcel in database. Operator searches for the parcel in post office. Client checks parcel content (optional). Client signs post notification. Operator gives parcel to client. Current state of issues: It is not very practical to use paper notification - they could be lost, damaged. This procces also includes the fact that postmen need to bring this notification to a client, and human factor issues; If post notification isn't acquired, parcel can stay in office for a long period of time (relevant for goods from internet shops); Uneven workload of the department during the month, which complicates the assessment of the time that can be spent in the queue at the office; As usual client don't have opportunity to leave any feedback fast and easy, if they were dissatisfied with operator's service. \"To be\" state \"To be\" state description: Client receives post notification via SMS or a messenger. Client authorizes in RP's app. Client chooses payment method and pays to take parcel in needed time. If parcel less than X,Y (X - size of parcel, Y - value in money amount), operator sends parcel in vending machine . If parcel more than X,Y operator takes it to checkout window. RP's system generates special QR code linked to client's parcel. Client receives this special QR code. In post office client scanning QR code: At checkout window, if parcel more than X,Y, and takes it. In a vending machine, if parcel less than X,Y and takes it. (optional) Client leaves feedback via feedback terminal. \"To be\" state pros: Client receives notification just in time when parcel came to post office. Client still has an option to take his parcel in old way (wait in a queue), but new option can generate extra revenue. So, there is no need to wait in a queue anymore, if client wants to take his parcel at a certain time. Client can also leave feedback via feedback terminal, which gives Post offices managers extra information of employees work.
